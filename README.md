# Autograding Example: Node
This is a simple node.js project. This project included a test file for grading purpose. 

### The assignment
Right now test is failing because there is a different between hello.js and hello.test.js file. 
1. accept the assignment.
2. open hello.js edit the file. it should return 'Hello world!' istead of 'Hello!'
3. save the changes. Fixing this up will make the tests green.


### Setup command
`npm install`

### Run command
`npm test`

### Notes
- Good luck!
